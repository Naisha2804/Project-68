                <h3>FROM THE PRINCIPAL’s DESK</h3>
                <p>“The function of education is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus character – that is the goal of true education” Martin Luther King
                    Education is not just literacy. It is a much broader concept than that. Imparting the right education is equipping a child not only with the knowledge of various subjects, but also empowering them with abilities and skills to face the various challenges of life. We have always aimed at the holistic development of every student, nurturing every important aspect – physical, cultural, emotional and intellectual.
                    The state-of-the-art facilities at Delhi Public School, Bangalore East and our dedicated staff, who are the proponents of the Institution’s ethos, provide our young scholars with innumerable opportunities to evolve as confident and thoughtful individuals, ready to make a place for themselves in this global world ruled by technology. The right balance of academics and co-curricular activities facilitate the development of multiple intelligences, honing the talent and intellect, and thus fostering all round development. Emphasis is also laid on imbibing the virtues of being humble, empathetic, compassionate, just, true, conscious about nature, energy conservation, recycling etc. that will go a long way in helping them to become responsible citizens of our country.
                    Wishing each one of you an experiential learning year.

                    With warm regards,
                    Manila Carvalho

                    <p>Student Life
                        We aim for a holistic growth of our students and lay equal emphasis on both academics and co-curricular activities. Our campus is always buzzing with some or the other activity that keeps our students motivated. Our students are grouped into four houses- Ganga, Cauvery, Narmada & Godavari in order to encourage greater participation in sports, cultural and literary activities. The House system inculcates a healthy spirit of competition and generates a sense of camaraderie among our students.
